	<h1 style="color: #444554;text-align: center;"> why drawing is a relaxing hobby</h1>

		<p style="color:#FAFFD8;text-align: center;"> <strong> fun fact about me </strong>: art (especially drawing) is one of the <strong> <em> only </em> </strong> hobbies throughout my life that i have not dropped. it is also one of the only hobbies i try to make time for and actively try to improve myself in.  </p>

		<p style="color:#FAFFD8;text-align: center;"> as you may already know, painting is a form of <em> expression</em> that utilizes items such as pens and pencils to recreate something that exists in real life, or in the artist's imagination. art can also be used for storytelling, as most books for children, for example, contain pictures to help them imagine the setting. <br/>
		<p style="color:#FAFFD8;text-align: center;"> this is not a new form of visualization; our distant ancestors long ago drew on the walls of caves, and these paintings depicted activities like hunting and gathering, and living beings such as animals and people. </p>

		<p style="color:#FAFFD8;text-align: center;"> nowadays, drawing is much, <strong> MUCH </strong> more different and advanced than just cave paintings- "traditional" art (pencils-on-paper art) exists alongside its newer form, digital art, which uses devices such as tablets and laptops and there are digital art programs, such as procreate for apple (that i use) that are available on the market. <br/>

			<h1> reasons why art is relaxing! (coming from an artist) </h1>

			<li style="color: #FAFFD8"> it helps me <strong> de-stress. </strong> because of the fact that school has so many assessments and things like that, i usually draw and paint at home to express something i feel visually </li>
			<li style="color:#FAFFD8"> even if the process maybe a bit... <em>stressful</em> at first, you'll get something nice to look at once you're done ! </li>
			<li style="color:#FAFFD8"> i personally think that you should just go with whatever method relaxes you more. if you get too stressed out at first, then just take baby steps first and slowly advance until you think you've gotten better ! <3 </li>
